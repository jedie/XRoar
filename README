XRoar - a Dragon/Tandy Coco emulator
Copyright 2003-2013 Ciaran Anscomb <xroar@6809.org.uk>


XRoar is a Dragon emulator that runs on a wide variety of platforms.
Due to hardware similarities, XRoar also emulates the Tandy Colour
Computer (CoCo) models 1 & 2.  Some features are:

   * Emulates Dragon 32, Dragon 64, Dragon 200-E, Tandy CoCo 1 & 2, and
     compatibles.
   * Emulates DragonDOS, Delta and RSDOS disk systems.
   * Emulates the Orchestra 90-CC stereo sound cartridge.
   * Supports both raw and translated keyboard modes.
   * Reads and writes virtual cassettes (compact '.cas' files and audio
     files).
   * Reads and writes VDK, JVC and DMK format virtual floppy diskettes.
   * Saves and loads machine snapshots.
   * Provides a GDB target for remote debugging.

   XRoar was originally written to run on Solaris, Linux and the GP32
handheld.  Later, it was ported to the Nintendo DS. Support has now been
dropped for the GP32 and NDS as emulation accuracy, and thus the CPU
requirement, has increased.

   XRoar is easily built from source under Linux, and binary packages
are provided for Mac OS X and Windows.

This README contains extracts from the manual.  Binary packages contain the
full manual as a PDF, which is also available from the XRoar home page
(http://www.6809.org.uk/xroar/).


Getting started
***************

Pre-built binary packages are available from the XRoar home page
(http://www.6809.org.uk/xroar/).  If one is not available for your
architecture, you will need to build from source.  XRoar should build
and run on any POSIX-like system for which SDL is available.

   You will also need BASIC ROM images--binary dumps of the firmware
from an original machine.  The originals were part-written by Microsoft,
so they are not distributed in the XRoar packages.


Installation

Building from source
====================

Dependencies
------------

If there is no binary package for your system, you will have to build
from source.  XRoar can use various backend toolkits, and you will need
to ensure you have their development files installed.  If you're using
Debian, this can (at the time of writing) be achieved with the following
simple command:

     $ sudo apt-get install build-essential libsndfile1-dev libgtk2.0-dev \
             libgtkglext1-dev libasound2-dev

   Under Mac OS X, first be sure to install Apple's Xcode
(https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) package.  The easiest way to then
ensure you have XRoar's dependencies available is to use a system like
Homebrew (http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) or MacPorts
(http://www.macports.org/).  For Homebrew, the following command will
install the required dependencies:

     $ brew install libsndfile sdl

   Otherwise, you'll have to do a bit of platform-specific research to
ensure you have all the dependencies for a full build:

   GTK+ (http://www.gtk.org/), the GIMP toolkit, provides the most
full-featured user interface.  It is only usable as such if you also
have GtkGlExt (http://projects.gnome.org/gtkglext/), an OpenGL extension
used to provide video output.  Otherwise, it can provide a file
requester for use by other user interfaces.

   SDL (http://www.libsdl.org/), Simple Directmedia Layer, provides a
more basic user experience, with most functionality only available
through the keyboard shortcuts.  Under Mac OS X, a special case of the
SDL UI is built that also provides some menus.  Unless you are building
for Linux, SDL is required to use joysticks.

   Other supported audio APIs: OSS, ALSA, PulseAudio, CoreAudio, JACK,
Sun audio (not tested in quite a while).

   libsndfile (http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/) is recommended to
enable support for using audio files as cassette images.

Compilation
-----------

Once you have the dependencies, building XRoar follows a familiar
procedure:

     $ gzip -dc xroar-0.31.tar.gz | tar xvf -
     $ cd xroar-0.31
     $ ./configure
     $ make
     $ sudo make install

   The 'configure' script has a lot of options guiding what it tests
for, specifying cross-compilation, changing the install path, etc.  List
them all with the '--help' option.  Be aware that this is a custom
script, it is not generated by the GNU build system.

   By default, 'configure' will set up an install _prefix_ of
'/usr/local', but this can be changed by using the '--prefix=PATH'
option.

   Once built, run 'make install' as root (or use 'sudo', as in the
example above) to install the binary and info documentation on your
system.  The executable is called 'xroar'.  ROM images should be placed
either in your home directory as '~/.xroar/roms/', or under the
installation _prefix_ as '_prefix_/share/xroar/roms/'.  Any
configuration file should be created as '~/.xroar/xroar.conf'.
