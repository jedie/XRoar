XRoar - a Dragon/Tandy Coco emulator
Copyright (C) 2003-2011 Ciaran Anscomb <xroar@6809.org.uk>


XRoar is a Dragon emulator that runs on a wide variety of platforms.
Due to hardware similarities, XRoar also emulates the Tandy Colour
Computer (CoCo) models 1 & 2.


This document just contains extracts from the manual covering
installation of XRoar from source.  If you downloaded a binary package,
the full manual should have been supplied with it as a PDF, which you
can consult for more details.  Binary packages and an online copy of
the documentation are available from the XRoar home page
(http://www.6809.org.uk/dragon/xroar.shtml).

Getting started
***************

To start, you will need to acquire (and maybe build) the software and
install it.  Pre-built binary packages are available from the XRoar
home page (http://www.6809.org.uk/dragon/xroar.shtml).  If one is not
available for your architecture, you will have to build from source.
XRoar should build and run on any POSIX-like system for which SDL
(http://www.libsdl.org/) is available.


Installation

Building from source code
=========================

If there is no binary package for your system, you will have to build
from source.  Before doing so, you should ensure you have the
dependencies required to build:

   * *GTK+*, the GIMP tookit, is used to provide a file requester on
     Linux and Unix builds.  It is available from the GTK+ home page
     (http://www.gtk.org/).

   * *GtkGLExt*, an OpenGL extension to GTK+.  This is optional, but if
     present, a full GTK+ interface can be presented.  Under Linux,
     this obviates the need for SDL entirely.

   * *SDL*, Simple Directmedia Layer, is used for video and audio
     output on most supported platforms.  It can be obtained from the
     SDL home page (http://www.libsdl.org/).

   * *libsndfile* is optional but recommended.  It allows XRoar to use
     audio files (such as WAVs) as a source for cassette input.  It is
     available on the libsndfile home page
     (http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/).

   If you use a modern Linux or Unix distribution, it's likely that
most of these packages will be installed by default, or easily
available through its package management system.

   The actual build process should be fairly straightforward and
follows the same steps as many other software packages.  Unpack the
source code, change into the created source directory, run `configure'
and then if everything looks good, run `make'.  Example:

     $ gzip -dc xroar-VERSION.tar.gz | tar xvf -
     $ cd xroar-VERSION
     $ ./configure
     $ make

   By default, `configure' will set things up to install to
`/usr/local', but this can be changed by using the
`--prefix=/path/to/destination' option.

   `configure' will detect any optionally supported drivers like Sun
audio, OpenGL video, etc.

   Once built, run `make install' to install the binary and info
documentation on your system.  Firmware ROM images should be placed
either in your home directory under `.xroar/roms/', or in
`_PREFIX_/share/xroar/roms/', where _PREFIX_ is the install prefix as
above.
